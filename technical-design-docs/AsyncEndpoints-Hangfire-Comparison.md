# AsyncEndpoints vs Hangfire: Performance and Feature Comparison

## Overview

This document compares AsyncEndpoints, a modern .NET library for asynchronous API operations with long-running background jobs, against Hangfire, a well-established background job processing framework for .NET.

## Architecture Comparison

### AsyncEndpoints

- **Architecture**: Producer-consumer pattern with HTTP endpoint integration
- **Core Model**: Request-response pattern where long-running operations return a job ID and allow status tracking
- **Storage**: In-memory (dev) and Redis (production) storage options
- **Job Lifecycle**: Jobs have explicit states (Queued, Scheduled, InProgress, Completed, Failed, Canceled)
- **State Transitions**: Strict validation of legal state transitions to prevent invalid job states

### Hangfire

- **Architecture**: Traditional background job processing with direct method execution
- **Core Model**: Direct method invocation in background with optional delay/recurring
- **Storage**: Multiple options (SQL Server, Redis, MSMQ) with extensive provider ecosystem
- **Job Lifecycle**: Jobs are function calls that execute, with automatic retry handling
- **Components**: Workers, recurring scheduler, schedule poller, expire manager as separate server components

## Performance Characteristics

### Storage Performance

**AsyncEndpoints:**

- In-memory storage: Fastest option, single-node only, no persistence
- Redis storage: Distributed, supports job recovery, optimized with Lua scripts
- Job structure optimized for HTTP context preservation (headers, route params, query params)
- Atomic operations using immutable objects pattern to prevent race conditions

**Hangfire:**

- SQL Server: Robust but potentially slower due to disk I/O
- Redis: Fast distributed storage with excellent performance
- MSMQ: High-performance but Windows-specific
- Multiple storage providers for flexibility

### Concurrency and Parallelism

**AsyncEndpoints:**

- Configurable worker concurrency based on processor count
- Semaphore-based job processing with controlled parallelism
- Background service with configurable polling intervals (default 1000ms)
- Channel-based job queue system for efficient processing

**Hangfire:**

- Highly configurable thread pool and parallelism settings
- Multiple server instances can work on same queues
- Queue-specific worker configuration
- Generally more mature concurrency handling

### Memory Management

**AsyncEndpoints:**

- Memory-efficient job storage with immutable objects
- Job lifecycle with clear states to prevent resource leaks
- HTTP context preservation without excessive memory overhead

**Hangfire:**

- More memory-intensive due to richer job metadata
- Automatic cleanup of completed jobs with expire manager
- More mature memory management with proven track record

## Use Case Scenarios

### AsyncEndpoints is Better For:

- HTTP APIs that need to return job IDs for long-running operations
- Applications requiring full HTTP context preservation
- Microservices with Redis infrastructure
- Clean, modern API design with fluent configuration
- AOT compatibility (has `IsAotCompatible=true`)
- Applications needing explicit job status tracking

### Hangfire is Better For:

- Traditional background job processing
- Applications requiring recurring/cron jobs
- Legacy systems with SQL Server infrastructure
- Applications needing built-in dashboard
- Complex job workflows and management
- More mature, battle-tested ecosystem
- Applications requiring advanced job filters and attributes

## Performance Benchmarks

### Throughput

- **AsyncEndpoints**: Optimized for HTTP endpoint scenarios, moderate throughput

Hangfire is a battle-tested, feature-rich solution for general background job processing with extensive configuration options, monitoring, and recurring job capabilities.

Choose AsyncEndpoints for HTTP API scenarios with explicit job tracking needs.
Choose Hangfire for complex background processing with recurring jobs and dashboard monitoring.

## Recommendations

For AsyncEndpoints to better compete with Hangfire, consider:

1. Adding a web dashboard for monitoring
2. Implementing recurring/cron job functionality
3. Supporting additional storage backends
4. Expanding the job management API
5. Creating more comprehensive documentation and examples
