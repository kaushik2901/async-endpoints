# AsyncEndpoints - Website Home Page Design

## Project Overview
**AsyncEndpoints** is a modern .NET library for building asynchronous APIs that handle long-running operations in the background. The library provides a clean, efficient solution for processing time-consuming tasks without blocking clients, using a producer-consumer pattern with configurable storage and retry mechanisms.

## Home Page Layout & Components

### 1. Hero Section
**Component:** Full-width premium banner with elegant gradient background (dark blue to light gray)
- **Brand Identity:** "AsyncEndpoints" in large, bold, modern typography
  - Subtle tagline: "Enterprise-Grade Asynchronous Processing for .NET"
- **Main Headline:** "Eliminate API Bottlenecks with Background Job Processing"
- **Executive Summary:** "A sophisticated .NET library enabling developers to offload time-consuming operations to background workers while maintaining full visibility and control through comprehensive job tracking and resilient failure handling"
- **Primary Call-to-Action Cluster:**
  - "Get Started" (primary button , linking to quick start)
  - "GitHub" (outline button with GitHub mark)
- **Supporting Information (Subtle badges below main CTAs):**
  - "MIT Licensed" badge 
  - "Open Source" badge
- **Visual Showcase:** Sophisticated split-panel design:
  - Left: Elegant syntax-highlighted code snippet showing the simplest possible implementation:
    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    
    builder.Services
        .AddAsyncEndpoints() // Core services
        .AddAsyncEndpointsInMemoryStore() // Dev storage
        .AddAsyncEndpointsWorker();       // Background processing
    
    var app = builder.Build();
    
    // Define async endpoint - returns 202 immediately
    app.MapAsyncPost<Request>("ProcessData", "/api/process-data");
    app.MapAsyncGetJobDetails("/jobs/{jobId:guid}"); // Job status endpoint
    
    await app.RunAsync();
    ```
  - Right: Professional representation showing immediate API response with job tracking details:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "5b7e0e4a-8f8b-4c8a-9f1f-8d8f8e8f8e8f",
      "name": "ProcessData",
      "status": "Queued",
      "retryCount": 0,
      "maxRetries": 3,
      "createdAt": "2025-10-14T10:30:00.000Z",
      "startedAt": null,
      "completedAt": null,
      "lastUpdatedAt": "2025-10-14T10:30:00.000Z",
      "result": null
    }
    ```
- **Core Benefits Row (Below Visual):**
  - "âš¡ Instant API Responses" - No more blocking clients during long operations
  - "ðŸ“Š Complete Job Visibility" - Track detailed status and progress of every background job
  - "ðŸ”„ Resilient Processing" - Automatic retries and circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
- **Technical Compatibility Bar (Bottom of hero):**
  - .NET 8+ | C# 12+ | Minimal APIs | Background Services | Redis | Entity Framework
- **Professional Assurance Statement:** 
  - "Trusted by development teams building scalable, enterprise-grade applications with robust background processing capabilities"
- **Page Load Animation:** Smooth entrance animation for all hero elements with staggered timing for premium feel
